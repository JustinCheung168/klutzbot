# klutzbot

General purpose Discord bot

Uses poetry for dependencies; get poetry, update dependencies using the provided poetry files, then run with:
`poetry run ./main.py`
in the top level directory.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to use poetry, then use: `python -m pip install .`.

You must provide a bot token in a ".env" file.
